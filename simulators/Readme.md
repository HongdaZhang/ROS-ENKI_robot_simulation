# Simulators
Two simulation environments have been designed for this project. The set-up guides and descriptions for Gazebo can be found in the [Gazebo Readme](https://github.com/a2198699s/AI-Line-Follower/blob/master/simulators/Gazebo/catkin_ws/src/Readme.md) and an Enki overview is provided in the [Enki Readme](https://github.com/a2198699s/AI-Line-Follower/blob/master/simulators/enkiSimulator/README.md).

## To get start
Try __EnkiSimulator__ first as the environment require less computation resource and easier to learn.

## Adding a Simulator

If you would like to add an additional simulator to the framework, ensure if meets the interface requirements as set out in the [specification](https://github.com/a2198699s/AI-Line-Follower/tree/master/interface_specifications).
