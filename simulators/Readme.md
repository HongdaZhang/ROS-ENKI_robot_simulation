# Simulators
Enki compilation and executing instructions are provided in the [Enki Readme](https://github.com/a2198699s/AI-Line-Follower/blob/master/simulators/enkiSimulator/README.md).

Gazebo is an optional simulator. It uses more computation resources than Enki. The compilation and executing instructions can be found in the [Gazebo Readme](https://github.com/a2198699s/AI-Line-Follower/blob/master/simulators/Gazebo/catkin_ws/src/Readme.md)

## Adding a Simulator

If you would like to add an additional simulator to the framework, ensure if meets the interface requirements as set out in the [specification](https://github.com/a2198699s/AI-Line-Follower/tree/master/interface_specifications).
